Here are the files to use for the p3t2 test case:

p3t2.cpp - this is the second test program.  See the comments at the
           top of the file for how to use it
evalBack.in - an input file for p3t2 which will test how your eval
              function works with a BACKWARD card 
evalBack.out - the solution output file for evalBack.in.  Diff your
              output against this
evalStart.in - an input file which will test your eval's treatment of
              a START card
evalStart.out - the solution output file for evalStart.in

To use the test, type these commands:

g++ -Wall -Werror p3.cpp p3t2.cpp -o p3t2
./p3t2 < evalBack.in > myEvalBack.out
diff myEvalBack.out evalBack.out

p3t2.cpp is not limited to using the two input files we have given.
The comments at the top of the file show the format for the input
files it uses - you may feel free to create your own eval test cases
using this format to test your code for other specific cases.
