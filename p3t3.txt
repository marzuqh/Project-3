We've got ANOTHER test case for you!

This is basically the same as p3t2, but whereas p3t2 tested your EVAL
function, this tests your APPLY function.

Here are the files for this test:

p3t3.cpp - this is the third test program.  See the comments at the
           top of the file for how to use it 
applyBack.in - an input file for p3t3 which will test how your apply
           function works with a BACKWARD card and pawn info 
applyBack.out - the solution output file for applyBack.in.  Diff your
           output against this 
applyStart.in - an input file which will test your apply's treatment
           of a START card and pawn info 
applyStart.out - the solution output file for applyStart.in

To use the test, type these commands:

g++ -Wall -Werror p3.cpp p3t3.cpp -o p3t3
./p3t3 < applyBack.in > myApplyBack.out
diff myApplyBack.out applyBack.out

Look familiar?  Yep, these are exactly the "Apply" equivalents of the
eval test cases from p3t2. 

As with p3t2, p3t3.cpp is not limited to using the two input files we
have given.  The comments at the top of the file show the format for
the input files it uses - you may feel free to create your own apply
test cases using this format to test your code for other specific
cases. (Hint: if you have already made your own eval test cases, you
only need to add some extra values to the bottom of those to make
apply test cases).
