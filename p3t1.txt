The first test case is ready now: a simple one that calls initGame
with the supplied arguments, and then prints out the result.  You can
compile it:

     $ g++ -o p3t1 -Wall -Werror p3.cpp p3t1.cpp

And run it:

     $ ./p3t1 sample.board sample.deck 2 10 yes > p3t1.out

And then check for differences:

     $ diff p3t1.out p3t1.answer

If you look at the result, it will look like this:

Feel free to make use of printGame in your own test cases.  You can
even include it in your p3.cpp for debugging/testing but DO NOT turn
in a version that prints board states!
