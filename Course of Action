Do this project in stages. 

1. Be able to read the board. 
2. Be able to read the deck. 
3. Write some diagnostic code that can print out boards and decks to make sure you are reading them correctly. 
   Test these functions with several different inputs. 
4. Once you can read the structures in, fill in the simple movement logic using just forward/backward movements and start, on a board with no slides. 
5. Once you have that working, add slides. 
6. Finally, add swap and sorry.
