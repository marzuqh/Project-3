These are the files for the T4 test case:

T4.board (the test case board file)
T4.deck (the test case deck file)
T4.out (the solution output)

To run, compile your p3.cpp with p3support.cpp as you would for a
normal test to read in all the regular arguments, and then run it like
this:

./p3 T4.board T4.deck 3 12 no > myT4.out
diff myT4.out T4.out

This is an end-to-end test case.  It covers forward, backward, swap,
sorry, start, bump on start, slide after swap, swap to home, and a few
others.  Yellow gets bashed, Green gets some glory.  You'll laugh,
you'll cry -- it's so good that you won't actually mind that red
doesn't even get to play.
